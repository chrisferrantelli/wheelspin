You ever struggle to decide what you want to play, watch, read, or do? It's honestly one of the biggest struggles in life, which is why I made this small script...


This is just a simple Pyton script that:

- Takes a list of items from the user
- Randomly eliminates one item in the **"primary round"**
- Runs a randomized **single-elimination tournament bracket** with the remaining items
- Displays each round and announces the final winner


Perfect for when you just can’t decide between:

- 🎥 Movies to watch  
- 🎮 Games to play  
- 📚 Books to read  
- 🍕 Food to eat
- 🏈 Whos making it to the Superbowl
- ✅ Anything else you want to put in a tournament!
